# Changes

## 0.0.5 - Keywords

* Identify IDL reserved words & some of the operators.
* Identify system variables (like `!DPI`).
* More carefully identify (some!) built-in functions & procedures.

## 0.0.4 - Functions and Procedures

* Try to identify functions and procedures.  Don't try to distinguish
  built-ins at this point.

## 0.0.3 - Strings

* Add highlighting of strings. It's pretty basic at this point.  There could
  well be exotic cases where it doesn't work.

## 0.0.2 - Numbers

* Add highlighting of numerical constants.

## 0.0.1 - First Release

* Just trying to get comments working.
